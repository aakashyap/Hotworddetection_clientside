# Hotworddetection_clientside
Client side solution using JavaScript to make IoT devices/voice assistant bots respond to specific hotwords. 
Your device/bot can be used completely as a hands free device. No need to press any buttons to activate command listening mode, just say the hotword of your choice like "Hey device" and your device will go in a mode where it will start comprehending any commands given after the hotword.
This is made using Artyom.js
Thanks to the devs for making such a wonderful library.
